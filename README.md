# Hospital Analytics Dashboard — Power BI Project

A complete end-to-end hospital analytics solution built using Power BI and multiple operational datasets.  
The dashboard delivers insights across **patients, doctors, billing, diagnostics, surgeries, medicines, beds, suppliers, and hospital operations**, helping leadership make informed, data-driven decisions.


## Project Overview

This Power BI solution integrates data from 15+ hospital sources including patient records, doctor schedules, medical tests, surgeries, medicine stock, billing transactions, room availability, and suppliers.

The dashboard helps hospital management:

- Identify revenue leakage  
- Understand patient flow and seasonal trends  
- Optimize doctor workload and appointment scheduling  
- Improve diagnostic and pharmacy performance  
- Reduce stockouts and inventory cost  
- Increase room/Premium occupancy  
- Enhance overall operational efficiency

## Key Insights

### **Patient Insights**
- 30 total patients; 73% discharged  
- Peak activity in **August** (11 discharges) → seasonal demand  
- 80% patients aged 31–60 → high diagnostic and chronic medicine demand  
- Seasonal patterns require additional staff and stock preparation

### **Doctor & Appointment Insights**
- 15 doctors, 35 appointments → workload imbalance  
- High reliance on 2–3 specialists → operational risk  
- Balanced scheduling can reduce wait times and increase service throughput

### **Financial Insights**
- **Surgery revenue:** 0.43M → highest contributor  
- **Room charges:** 0.17M  
- **Diagnostics:** Only 0.05M (7%) → major underperformance  
- **Medicine revenue:** Extremely low (0.01M) despite 3928 units consumed  
- Clear signs of **pharmacy revenue leakage**

### **Inventory Insights**
- Critical shortages: Insulin, Ibuprofen  
- Overstocked slow-moving drugs → blocked capital  
- Peak medicine usage in June (~900 units)

### **Operational Insights**
- ICU near overcapacity  
- Private rooms at 0% occupancy → missed premium revenue  
- Surgery delays reduce OT utilization  
- Bed occupancy patterns highlight room for optimization  


## Strategic Recommendations

### **Revenue Growth**
- Increase diagnostics from **0.05M → 0.12M**  
- Boost pharmacy revenue from **0.01M → 0.05M**  
- Improve private room occupancy to **40%**  
- Increase surgery throughput from **3 → 5 per quarter**

### **Operational Efficiency**
- Convert 2 general beds → ICU  
- Reduce slow-moving inventory by **25%**  
- Improve doctor scheduling → reduce wait times by **20%**  
- Standardize OT scheduling to avoid surgery delays

### **Patient Experience**
- Standardize doctor–patient communication  
- Ensure zero critical stockouts  
- Improve follow-up reminders (SMS/WhatsApp)  


## Future Enhancements

- Real-time database connectivity  
- Predictive analytics for admissions & medicine demand  
- Automated stock reorder alerts  
- Complete Patient 360° view (tests + medicines + billing + satisfaction)
